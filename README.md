## Description

My goal for this project was to build a scalable, user-focused MERN application that works with data to solve a real-world challenge.

### Concept

I created **Pro**, a data-driven project management tool for software development teams. 

Underscroping is the most common cause of bugs in software development

My motivation for creating this application was to

### User Story

```
AS A software development team manager
I WANT a data-driven project management tool
SO THAT I can accurately predict project completion timelines.
```

Currently, Pawfect Match achieves this by allowing its users to post pets and interact via public comments on the post. Possible features that could be implemented in the future to improve the application include:
- Private messaging between current and potential owners
- Making appointments to meet through the application
- And, suggested profile matching for pets needing adoption and people wanting to adopt.

### Tools and Technologies Used

To create Pro, I used:
- React-Bootstrap
- Node.js 
- Express.js
- Bcrypt
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JSON Web Tokens
- Chart.js
- And, Heroku.

1. Open the root directory of the repository in your terminal or bash.
2. Bundle the front-end code by entering ```npm run build``` in the command line.
3. Start the server by entering ```npm run start``` in the command line and go to the port on your local host OR use the complete application by entering ```npm run develop``` in the command line and go to the port on your local host.
